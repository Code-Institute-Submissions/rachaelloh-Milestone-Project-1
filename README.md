# Milestone Project 1
## Intro
The main purpose of creating this website is to share and promote support for local talent- particularly Jonathan Lim, an artist who depicts seemingly mundane local scenes into something emotional and beautiful.

In this website, Jonathan is introduced along with his artworks. Even though these are scenes that many of us (Singaporeans) see in our daily lives, the artist is able to bring out another side of these scenes and give new perspectives that we seem to take for granted.
