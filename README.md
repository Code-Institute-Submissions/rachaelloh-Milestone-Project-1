# Milestone Project 1
## Introduction
The main purpose of creating this website is to share and promote support for local talent- particularly Jonathan Lim, an artist who depicts seemingly mundane local scenes into something emotional and beautiful.

In this website, Jonathan is introduced along with his artworks. Even though these are scenes that many of us (Singaporeans) see in our daily lives, the artist is able to bring out another side of these scenes and give new perspectives that we seem to take for granted.

## Demo
A live website can be found here https://rachaelloh.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/

## UX/UI
### Strategy
-As a local artiste (singer/songwriter), I am looking for a potential collaboration with an artist for my album cover.  

-As a person who does not know about this artist’s works, I want to know who he is and the inspirations behind his pieces.

-As a Singaporean, I am interested to find out more about local productions.

-As a supporter, I wish to be kept updated of his works and upcoming exhibitions where I can go for. 

### Scope
The website will be designed based on the identified goals and hence placed in the following sections:

Home page- Landing page with carousel (image slides) and quotes by artist through interviews.

Bio page- Short “About” section to introduce the artist, contact form at the bottom of page

Features page- Some of the featured artist’s work will be shown in this page + video of an interview

Gallery page- More of artist’s artworks
